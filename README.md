## 🔍 Overview

This project was completed as part of the **Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Data Science & Analytics Virtual Experience** on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/bcg/data-science-ccdz). The virtual internship simulates a real-world data science engagement with **PowerCo**, a major European energy utility facing high churn rates among its Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) customers.

The goal of this experience was to apply data-driven methodologies to understand customer churn dynamics and develop predictive insights that inform retention strategies—particularly regarding price sensitivity and discount-driven interventions.

## 🏢 Client Background

**PowerCo** serves a wide range of customers, from large corporations to SMEs and residential users. Amidst market liberalization in Europe, PowerCo has been experiencing increased churn, especially among SMEs. In partnership with BCG, the company is seeking to:

- Understand the drivers behind customer churn.
- Evaluate whether pricing changes are a key influence.
- Predict which customers are most likely to churn.
- Estimate the effectiveness of targeted discount strategies (e.g., a 20% price reduction) in retaining customers.

## 📌 Project Structure

### ✅ Task 1: Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing

- Formulated a clear hypothesis: *“Customers with higher price sensitivity are more likely to churn.”*
- Translated this business challenge into a predictive data science problem.
- Outlined the required data inputs (e.g., pricing history, usage patterns, customer tenure).
- Proposed a high-level analytical approach including data exploration, correlation analysis, and classification modeling.

---

### 📊 Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Analyzed customer profiles, pricing structures, and churn distribution.
- Evaluated variable distributions and performed statistical tests to verify correlation between price changes and churn.
- Key insights:
  - Certain customer segments showed a strong link between price increases and churn probability.
  - Usage behavior and contract type emerged as additional influencing factors.
- Recommended additional data (e.g., customer satisfaction scores, competitive rates) to improve model accuracy.

---

### 🧠 Task 3: Feature Engineering & Modeling

- Created new features from time-based usage metrics, price volatility, customer tenure, and more.
- Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict churn with strong performance.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and AUC.
- Discussed the pros and cons of using Random Forests:
  - ✅ Strengths: Handles nonlinearities, interpretable feature importance.
  - ❌ Weaknesses: Limited extrapolation, less transparent than simpler models.
- Bonus Insight: Predicted cost savings from a well-targeted discount policy based on the model’s outputs.

---

### 📈 Task 4: Key Findings & Strategic Recommendations

- Developed an executive-ready summary of results and recommendations.
- Highlighted key metric: **Churn probability reduction through targeted discounting**.
- Strategic impact:
  - Increased customer retention.
  - Better ROI on discounts by focusing on high-risk, price-sensitive customers.
  - Insights from model can be scaled across other business units.

## 🧩 Technologies & Tools Used

- **Python** (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and modeling
- **Statistical hypothesis testing** and data visualization techniques
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest Classifier
